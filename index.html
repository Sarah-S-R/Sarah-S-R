<dl>
<dt>git add</dt>
<dd>Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.
     This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history. </dd>

    <dt>git branch</dt>
<dd>This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool.
     It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository. </dd>

    <dt>git clone</dt>
<dd>Creates a copy of an existing Git repository.
     Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository. </dd>

    <dt>git commit</dt>
<dd>Takes the staged snapshot and commits it ti the prjoect history. Combined with git add, 
    this defines the basic workflow for all git users. </dd>

    <dt>git commit-amend</dt>
<dd>Passing the --amend flag to git commit lets you amend the most recent commit. 
    This is very useful when you forget to stage a file or omit important information from the commit message. </dd>

    <dt>git config</dt>
<dd>A convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation.
     You'll typically only need to use this immediately after installing Git on a new development machine. </dd>

    <dt>git fetch</dt>
<dd>Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to integrate anything into your local repository.
     This gives you a chance to inspect changes before merging them with your project. </dd>

    <dt>git merge</dt>
<dd>A powerful way to integrate changes from divergent branches.
     After forking the project history with git branch, git merge lets you put it back together again. </dd>

    <dt>git pull</dt>
<dd>Pulling is the automated version of git fetch. It downloads a branch from a remote repository, 
    then immediately merges it into the current branch. This is the Git equivalent of svn update. </dd>

    <dt>git push</dt>
<dd>Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions.
     This is like svn commit, but it sends a series of commits instead of a single change set. </dd>
